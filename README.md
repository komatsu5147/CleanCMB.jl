# CleanCMB

This package contains functions to enable extraction of clean maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Some functions can be used to extract non-CMB astrophysical components as well.

Different algorithms exist for extraction of clean maps of the CMB. The package currently contains
- `harmonic_ilc_weights(args)`: Multiple-dispatch function to returns weights for the internal linear combination (ILC) method in harmonic space, following Equation ()
