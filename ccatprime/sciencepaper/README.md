# Measuring CMB foregrounds to aid the search for primordial gravitational waves

You can reproduce the results in Section 6 of the CCAT-prime science forecast paper. To reproduce Figure 6 and 7, use [PlotFigure6.jl](https://github.com/komatsu5147/CleanCMB.jl/tree/master/ccatprime/sciencepaper/PlotFigure6.jl) and  [PlotFigure7.jl](https://github.com/komatsu5147/CleanCMB.jl/tree/master/ccatprime/sciencepaper/PlotFigure7.jl), respectively. They will read in the data files provided in [sosat/](https://github.com/komatsu5147/CleanCMB.jl/tree/master/ccatprime/sciencepaper/sosat) and [sosatfyst/](https://github.com/komatsu5147/CleanCMB.jl/tree/master/ccatprime/sciencepaper/sosatfyst):
- `beta_results.csv` (generated by `ComputeBeta.jl`): The best-fitting values of the foreground parameters (synchrotron index `βs`, dust index `βd`, dust temperature `Td`).
- `milca_results.csv` (generated by `PerformMILCA.jl`): The best-fitting tensor-to-scalar ratio parameters `r` without and with marginalisation over the residual foreground power spectrum.

While not used for the figures, `ilc_results.csv` (generated by `PerformILC.jl`) contains `r` derived from the internal linear combination (ILC) method for comparison.
